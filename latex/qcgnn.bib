One such challenging task is to distinguish quark-initiated jets from gluon-initiated jets. Following previous work, we treat the jet as an image by pixelizing track information and calorimeter deposits as reconstructed by the detector. We test the deep learning paradigm by training several recently developed, state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks on the quark-gluon discrimination task. We compare the results obtained using various network architectures trained for quark-gluon discrimination and also a boosted decision tree (BDT) trained on summary variables.},

Top tagging in fat jets offers a well-defined framework to establish our DeepTop approach and compare its performance to QCD-based top taggers. We first optimize a network architecture to identify top quarks in Monte Carlo simulations of the Standard Model production channel. Using standard fat jets we then compare its performance to a multivariate QCD-based top tagger. We find that both approaches lead to comparable performance, establishing convolutional networks as a promising new approach for multivariate hypothesis-based top tagging.},

  abstract      = {Artificial intelligence offers the potential to automate challenging data-processing tasks in collider physics. To establish its prospects, we explore to what extent deep learning with convolutional neural networks can discriminate quark and gluon jets better than observables designed by physicists. Our approach builds upon the paradigm that a jet can be treated as an image, with intensity given by the local calorimeter deposits. We supplement this construction by adding color to the images, with red, green and blue intensities given by the transverse momentum in charged particles, transverse momentum in neutral particles, and pixel-level charged particle counts. Overall, the deep networks match or outperform traditional jet variables. We also find that, while various simulations produce different quark and gluon jets, the neural networks are surprisingly insensitive to these differences, similar to traditional observables. This suggests that the networks can extract robust physical information from imperfect simulations.},

  abstract      = {Deep learning techniques are currently being investigated for high energy physics experiments, to tackle a wide range of problems, with quark and gluon discrimination becoming a benchmark for new algorithms. One weakness is the traditional reliance on Monte Carlo simulations, which may not be well modelled at the detail required by deep learning algorithms. The weakly supervised learning paradigm gives an alternate route to classification, by using samples with different quark-gluon proportions instead of fully labeled samples. This paradigm has, therefore, huge potential for particle physics classification problems as these weakly supervised learning methods can be applied directly to collision data. In this study, we show that realistically simulated samples of dijet and Z+jet events can be used to discriminate between quark and gluon jets by using weakly supervised learning. We implement and compare the performance of weakly supervised learning for quark-gluon jet classification using three different machine learning methods: the jet image-based convolutional neural network, the particle-based recurrent neural network and and the feature-based boosted decision tree.},

  abstract      = {Since the machine learning techniques are improving rapidly, it has been shown that the image recognition techniques in deep neural networks can be used to detect jet substructure. And it turns out that deep neural networks can match or outperform traditional approach of expert features. However, there are disadvantages such as sparseness of jet images. Based on the natural tree-like structure of jet sequential clustering, the recursive neural networks (RecNNs), which embed jet clustering history recursively as in natural language processing, have a better behavior when confronted with these problems. We thus try to explore the performance of RecNNs in quark/gluon discrimination. The results show that RecNNs work better than the baseline boosted decision tree (BDT) by a few percent in gluon rejection rate. However, extra implementation of particle flow identification only increases the performance slightly. We also experimented on some relevant aspects which might influence the performance of the networks. It shows that even taking only particle flow identification as input feature without any extra information on momentum or angular position is already giving a fairly good result, which indicates that the most of the information for quark/gluon discrimination is already included in the tree-structure itself. As a bonus, a rough up/down quark jets discrimination is also explored.},

In this work, we present a novel class of recursive neural networks built instead upon an analogy between QCD and natural languages. In the analogy, four-momenta are like words and the clustering history of sequential recombination jet algorithms is like the parsing of a sentence. Our approach works directly with the four-momenta of a variable-length set of particles, and the jet-based tree structure varies on an event-by-event basis. Our experiments highlight the flexibility of our method for building task-specific jet embeddings and show that recursive architectures are significantly more accurate and data efficient than previous image-based networks. We extend the analogy from individual jets (sentences) to full events (paragraphs), and show for the first time an event-level classifier operating on all the stable particles produced in an LHC event.},

Based on a representation learned from these interactions, the jet is associated to one of the considered categories.

@article{jet_graph3,
  abstract      = {Classification of jets with deep learning has gained significant attention in recent times. However, the performance of deep neural networks is often achieved at the cost of interpretability. Here we propose an interpretable network trained on the jet spectrum S2(R) which is a two-point correlation function of the jet constituents. The spectrum can be derived from a functional Taylor series of an arbitrary jet classifier function of energy flows. An interpretable network can be obtained by truncating the series. The intermediate feature of the network is an infrared and collinear safe C-correlator which allows us to estimate the importance of an S2(R) deposit at an angular scale R in the classification. The performance of the architecture is comparable to that of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on jet images, although the number of inputs and complexity of the architecture is significantly simpler than the CNN classifier. We consider two examples: one is the classification of two-prong jets which differ in color charge of the mother particle, and the other is a comparison between Pythia 8 and Herwig 7 generated jets.},

@article{jet_graph4,
  abstract      = {Deep neural networks trained on jet images have been successful in classifying different kinds of jets. In this paper, we identify the crucial physics features that could reproduce the classification performance of the convolutional neural network in the top jet vs. QCD jet classification. We design a neural network that considers two types of sub-structural features: two-point energy correlations, and the IRC unsafe counting variables of a morphological analysis of jet images. The new set of IRC unsafe variables can be described by Minkowski functionals from integral geometry. To integrate these features into a single framework, we reintroduce two-point energy correlations in terms of a graph neural network and provide the other features to the network afterward. The network shows a comparable classification performance to the convolutional neural network. Since both networks are using IRC unsafe features at some level, the results based on simulations are often dependent on the event generator choice. We compare the classification results of Pythia 8 and Herwig 7, and a simple reweighting on the distribution of IRC unsafe features reduces the difference between the results from the two simulations.},

Graph neural networks are trainable functions which operate on graphs—sets of elements and their pairwise relations—and are a central method within the broader field of geometric deep learning. They are very expressive and have demonstrated superior performance to other classical deep learning approaches in a variety of domains. The data in particle physics are often represented by sets and graphs and as such, graph neural networks offer key advantages. Here we review various applications of graph neural networks in particle physics, including different graph constructions, model architectures and learning objectives, as well as key open problems in particle physics for which graph neural networks are promising.}

  abstract      = {Deep learning methods have been increasingly adopted to study jets in particle physics. Since symmetry-preserving behavior has been shown to be an important factor for improving the performance of deep learning in many applications, Lorentz group equivariance ---a fundamental spacetime symmetry for elementary particles ---has recently been incorporated into a deep learning model for jet tagging. However, the design is computationally costly due to the analytic construction of high-order tensors. In this article, we introduce LorentzNet, a new symmetry-preserving deep learning model for jet tagging. The message passing of LorentzNet relies on an efficient Minkowski dot product attention. Experiments on two representative jet tagging benchmarks show that LorentzNet achieves the best tagging performance and improves significantly over existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The preservation of Lorentz symmetry also greatly improves the efficiency and generalization power of the model, allowing LorentzNet to reach highly competitive performance when trained on only a few thousand jets.},

Practical computational efforts for training state-of-the-art models can now only be handled by high speed computer hardware. As this trend is expected to continue, it should come as no surprise that an increasing number of machine learning researchers are investigating the possible advantages of quantum computing. The scientific literature on Quantum Machine Learning is now enormous, and a review of its current state that can be comprehended without a physics background is necessary. The objective of this study is to present a review of Quantum Machine Learning from the perspective of conventional techniques. Departing from giving a research path from fundamental quantum theory through Quantum Machine Learning algorithms from a computer scientist&rsquo;s perspective, we discuss a set of basic algorithms for Quantum Machine Learning, which are the fundamental components for Quantum Machine Learning algorithms. We implement the Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QNNs) on a quantum computer to recognize handwritten digits, and compare its performance to that of its classical counterpart, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Additionally, we implement the QSVM on the breast cancer dataset and compare it to the classical SVM. Finally, we implement the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) and many classical classifiers on the Iris dataset to compare their accuracies.},

@article{qml4,
  abstract       = {Quantum computing has been proven to excel in factorization issues and unordered search problems due to its capability of quantum parallelism. This unique feature allows exponential speed-up in solving certain problems. However, this advantage does not apply universally, and challenges arise when combining classical and quantum computing to achieve acceleration in computation speed. This paper aims to address these challenges by exploring the current state of quantum machine learning and benchmarking the performance of quantum and classical algorithms in terms of accuracy. Specifically, we conducted experiments with three datasets for binary classification, implementing Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Quantum SVM (QSVM) algorithms. Our findings suggest that the QSVM algorithm outperforms classical SVM on complex datasets, and the performance gap between quantum and classical models increases with dataset complexity, as simple models tend to overfit with complex datasets. While there is still a long way to go in terms of developing quantum hardware with sufficient resources, quantum machine learning holds great potential in areas such as unsupervised learning and generative models. Moving forward, more efforts are needed to explore new quantum learning models that can leverage the power of quantum mechanics to overcome the limitations of classical machine learning.},

Quantum computing was postulated in the early 1980s as way to perform computations that would not be tractable with a classical computer.

  abstract      = {Tensor Networks are non-trivial representations of high-dimensional tensors, originally designed to describe quantum many-body systems. We show that Tensor Networks are ideal vehicles to connect quantum mechanical concepts to machine learning techniques, thereby facilitating an improved interpretability of neural networks. This study presents the discrimination of top quark signal over QCD background processes using a Matrix Product State classifier. We show that entanglement entropy can be used to interpret what a network learns, which can be used to reduce the complexity of the network and feature space without loss of generality or performance. For the optimisation of the network, we compare the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and propose a joined training algorithm to harness the explainability of DMRG with the efficiency of SGD.},

  abstract      = {Quantum machine learning aims to release the prowess of quantum computing to improve machine learning methods. By combining quantum computing methods with classical neural network techniques we aim to foster an increase of performance in solving classification problems. Our algorithm is designed for existing and near-term quantum devices. We propose a novel hybrid variational quantum classifier that combines the quantum gradient descent method with steepest gradient descent to optimise the parameters of the network. By applying this algorithm to a resonance search in di-top final states, we find that this method has a better learning outcome than a classical neural network or a quantum machine learning method trained with a non-quantum optimisation method. The classifiers ability to be trained on small amounts of data indicates its benefits in data-driven classification problems.},

We focus on variational quantum approach to learn the properties of input data and evaluate the performance of the event classification using both simulators and quantum computing devices. Comparison of the performance with standard multi-variate classification techniques based on a boosted-decision tree and a deep neural network using classical computers shows that the quantum algorithm has comparable performance with the standard techniques at the considered ranges of the number of input variables and the size of training samples. The variational quantum algorithm is tested with quantum computers, demonstrating that the discrimination of interesting events from background is feasible. Characteristic behaviors observed during a learning process using quantum circuits with extended gate structures are discussed, as well as the implications of the current performance to the application in high-energy physics experiments.},

  abstract   = {One of the major objectives of the experimental programs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the discovery of new physics. This requires the identification of rare signals in immense backgrounds. Using machine learning algorithms greatly enhances our ability to achieve this objective. With the progress of quantum technologies, quantum machine learning could become a powerful tool for data analysis in high energy physics. In this study, using IBM gate-model quantum computing systems, we employ the quantum variational classifier method in two recent LHC flagship physics analyses:  (Higgs boson production in association with a top quark pair, probing the Higgs boson couplings to the top quark) and H → μ + μ − (Higgs boson decays to two muons, probing the Higgs boson couplings to second-generation fermions). We have obtained early results with 10 qubits on the IBM quantum simulator and the IBM quantum hardware. With small training samples of 100 events on the quantum simulator, the quantum variational classifier method performs similarly to classical algorithms such as SVM (support vector machine) and BDT (boosted decision tree), which are often employed in LHC physics analyses. On the quantum hardware, the quantum variational classifier method has shown promising discrimination power, comparable to that on the quantum simulator. This study demonstrates that quantum machine learning has the ability to differentiate between signal and background in realistic physics datasets. We foresee the usage of quantum machine learning in future high-luminosity LHC physics analyses, including measurements of the Higgs boson self-couplings and searches for dark matter.},

  abstract      = {Photonic Quantum Computers provide several benefits over the discrete qubit-based paradigm of quantum computing. By using the power of continuous-variable computing we build an anomaly detection model to use on searches for New Physics. Our model uses Gaussian Boson Sampling, a {\#}P-hard problem and thus not efficiently accessible to classical devices. This is used to create feature vectors from graph data, a natural format for representing data of high-energy collision events. A simple K-means clustering algorithm is used to provide a baseline method of classification. We then present a novel method of anomaly detection, combining the use of Gaussian Boson Sampling and a quantum extension to K-means known as Q-means. This is found to give equivalent results compared to the classical clustering version while also reducing the {\$}{\$} {$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}O{\}} {\$}{\$}complexity, with respect to the sample's feature-vector length, from {\$}{\$} {$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}O{\}}(N) {\$}{\$}to {\$}{\$} {$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}O{\}}{$\backslash$}left({$\backslash$}log (N){$\backslash$}right) {\$}{\$}.},

The performance of the quantum algorithms was found to be comparable to the classical ones, even when using large datasets. Sequential Backward Selection and Principal Component Analysis techniques were used for feature's selection and while the former can produce the better quantum machine learning models in specific cases, it is more unstable.

  abstract  = {Much hope for finding new physics phenomena at microscopic scale relies on the observations obtained from High Energy Physics experiments, like the ones performed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, current experiments do not indicate clear signs of new physics that could guide the development of additional Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories. Identifying signatures of new physics out of the enormous amount of data produced at the LHC falls into the class of anomaly detection and constitutes one of the greatest computational challenges. In this article, we propose a novel strategy to perform anomaly detection in a supervised learning setting, based on the artificial creation of anomalies through a random process. For the resulting supervised learning problem, we successfully apply classical and quantum support vector classifiers (CSVC and QSVC respectively) to identify the artificial anomalies among the SM events. Even more promising, we find that employing an SVC trained to identify the artificial anomalies, it is possible to identify realistic BSM events with high accuracy. In parallel, we also explore the potential of quantum algorithms for improving the classification accuracy and provide plausible conditions for the best exploitation of this novel computational paradigm.}

  abstract  = {The quantum angle generator (QAG) is a new full quantum machine learning model designed to generate accurate images on current noise intermediate scale quantum devices. Variational quantum circuits form the core of the QAG model, and various circuit architectures are evaluated. In combination with the so-called MERA-upsampling architecture, the QAG model achieves excellent results, which are analyzed and evaluated in detail. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a quantum model has achieved such accurate results. To explore the robustness of the model to noise, an extensive quantum noise study is performed. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the model trained on a physical quantum device learns the noise characteristics of the hardware and generates outstanding results. It is verified that even a quantum hardware machine calibration change during training of up to 8% can be well tolerated. For demonstration, the model is employed in indispensable simulations in high energy physics required to measure particle energies and, ultimately, to discover unknown particles at the large Hadron Collider at CERN.}

Quantum computers promise a solution, although fault-tolerant quantum computers will probably not be available in the near future. Current quantum devices have serious constraints, including limited numbers of qubits and noise processes that limit circuit depth. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which use a classical optimizer to train a parameterized quantum circuit, have emerged as a leading strategy to address these constraints. VQAs have now been proposed for essentially all applications that researchers have envisaged for quantum computers, and they appear to be the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including the trainability, accuracy and efficiency of VQAs. Here we overview the field of VQAs, discuss strategies to overcome their challenges and highlight the exciting prospects for using them to obtain quantum advantage.},

For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ans{\"a}tze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry---calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He--H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

  abstract   = {Many quantum algorithms have daunting resource requirements when compared to what is available today. To address this discrepancy, a quantum-classical hybrid optimization scheme known as `the quantum variational eigensolver' was developed (Peruzzo et al 2014 Nat. Commun. 5 4213) with the philosophy that even minimal quantum resources could be made useful when used in conjunction with classical routines. In this work we extend the general theory of this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for practical implementations. Specifically, we develop a variational adiabatic ansatz and explore unitary coupled cluster where we establish a connection from second order unitary coupled cluster to universal gate sets through a relaxation of exponential operator splitting. We introduce the concept of quantum variational error suppression that allows some errors to be suppressed naturally in this algorithm on a pre-threshold quantum device. Additionally, we analyze truncation and correlated sampling in Hamiltonian averaging as ways to reduce the cost of this procedure. Finally, we show how the use of modern derivative free optimization techniques can offer dramatic computational savings of up to three orders of magnitude over previously used optimization techniques.},

In this research, a systematic survey of GNNs and their advances in bioinformatics is presented from multiple perspectives. We first introduce some commonly used GNN models and their basic principles. Then, three representative tasks are proposed based on the three levels of structural information that can be learned by GNNs: node classification, link prediction, and graph generation. Meanwhile, according to the specific applications for various omics data, we categorize and discuss the related studies in three aspects: disease prediction, drug discovery, and biomedical imaging. Based on the analysis, we provide an outlook on the shortcomings of current studies and point out their developing prospect. Although GNNs have achieved excellent results in many biological tasks at present, they still face challenges in terms of low-quality data processing, methodology, and interpretability and have a long road ahead. We believe that GNNs are potentially an excellent method that solves various biological problems in bioinformatics research.},

@article{pfn,
  abstract      = {A key question for machine learning approaches in particle physics is how to best represent and learn from collider events. As an event is intrinsically a variable-length unordered set of particles, we build upon recent machine learning efforts to learn directly from sets of features or ``point clouds''. Adapting and specializing the ``Deep Sets''framework to particle physics, we introduce Energy Flow Networks, which respect infrared and collinear safety by construction. We also develop Particle Flow Networks, which allow for general energy dependence and the inclusion of additional particle-level information such as charge and flavor. These networks feature a per-particle internal (latent) representation, and summing over all particles yields an overall event-level latent representation. We show how this latent space decomposition unifies existing event representations based on detector images and radiation moments. To demonstrate the power and simplicity of this set-based approach, we apply these networks to the collider task of discriminating quark jets from gluon jets, finding similar or improved performance compared to existing methods. We also show how the learned event representation can be directly visualized, providing insight into the inner workings of the model. These architectures lend themselves to efficiently processing and analyzing events for a wide variety of tasks at the Large Hadron Collider. Implementations and examples of our architectures are available online in our EnergyFlowpackage.},

  abstract  = {The kt and Cambridge/Aachen inclusive jet finding algorithms for hadron-hadron collisions can be seen as belonging to a broader class of sequential recombination jet algorithms, parametrised by the power of the energy scale in the distance measure. We examine some properties of a new member of this class, for which the power is negative. This ``anti-kt'' algorithm essentially behaves like an idealised cone algorithm, in that jets with only soft fragmentation are conical, active and passive areas are equal, the area anomalous dimensions are zero, the non-global logarithms are those of a rigid boundary and the Milan factor is universal.  None of these properties hold for existing sequential recombination algorithms, nor for cone algorithms with split-merge steps, such as SISCone. They are however the identifying characteristics of the collinear unsafe plain ``iterative cone'' algorithm, for which the anti-kt algorithm provides a natural, fast, infrared and collinear safe replacement.}

@article{q_kernel1,
  abstract      = {Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies that each have the potential to alter how computation is performed to address previously untenable problems. Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous in pattern recognition, with support vector machines (SVMs) being the best known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such classification problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element in the computational speed-ups enabled by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here we propose and experimentally implement two quantum algorithms on a superconducting processor. A key component in both methods is the use of the quantum state space as feature space. The use of a quantum-enhanced feature space that is only efficiently accessible on a quantum computer provides a possible path to quantum advantage. The algorithms solve a problem of supervised learning: the construction of a classifier. One method, the quantum variational classifier, uses a variational quantum circuit1,2 to classify the data in a way similar to the method of conventional SVMs. The other method, a quantum kernel estimator, estimates the kernel function on the quantum computer and optimizes a classical SVM. The two methods provide tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers3 to machine learning.},
